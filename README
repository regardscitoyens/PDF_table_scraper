PDF table scraper
-----------------

This script attempts to extract the data of a table from a pdf file.

It considers every single page of a pdf as a table, and attempts to make sense
of it. The output should be much easier to parse and 'somehow clean', but a
manual checking is required over the results.

It currently exports the data as a .html (for visualization) as well as in .csv
or in Python pickle form, for reuse in another script.
